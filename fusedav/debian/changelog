fusedav (0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Updated to standards-version 3.8.4 -- no changes.
    - Build-depend on libneon27-gnutls-dev rather than libneon26-gnutls-dev.
    - Let fusedav depend on ${misc:Depends} as suggested by debhelper.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use 'filter' rather than 'findstring' to make sure to match words rather
      than substrings.
  * debian/patches:
    - Added bts532763-neon27, adding support for neon27; thanks to Andreas
      Metzler for reporting this (Closes: #532763).
    - Simplified ne_lfs -- check for NE_FEATURE_LFS only if ne_off_t is not
      large enough for LFS; any other checks/defines are no longer required
      for neon27.
  * debian/README.source:
    - Added generic instructions for dpatch.
